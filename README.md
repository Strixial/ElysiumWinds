# Elysium Winds
This repo isn't actually anything to do with the code. It's an Obsidian vault for ideas of the game.

If you found this, well done!

### Contribution Instructions
You will need Obsidian and Git on your PC.

In a folder that you want this vault in, run in a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Strixial/ElysiumWinds
```

[Authenticate in Git](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Authentication) if you haven't already.

Once done, open Obsidian, then open the `ElysiumWinds` folder as a vault, and you're done.

Remember to commit all changes then push. Both are in the command palette (Ctrl+P).
