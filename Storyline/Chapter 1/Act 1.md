On a small, sandy beach, laying on the Relbra Coast, the scene was as tranquil as ever, still having the peaceful atmosphere of nighttime, as the sun rises gently over the horizon. It was indeed a small beach, maybe a hundred paces long, surrounded by fairly tall cliffs, one especially sticking out, and casting a large shadow on the sand in the early sun's light. A large, now dry, river bed cut through the powerful cliffs, leading a path through them, a truly decorated path, with trees, bushes, and flowers growing alongside it. As the wind swept across the seaside, nothing dared move, nor make a noise, with the exception of the waves at the boundary between sea and land. Everything was peaceful.

On the sea, a visitor floats, without consciousness, toward the beach where everything was so peaceful. The gentle waves slowly pushed them toward the coast, until eventually they beached up into the sand, still laying unconscious. For a while, they remained there like that, unmoving as the diorama around them.

Eventually, their eyes slowly opened, blinking strongly, still having seawater in it. Their head turned over to look at the sky. Clear, with some traces of clouds, lit gold by the morning sun. They rolled onto their back, and then sat up, facing the sea that brought them here. A worse fate could have awaited them, but despite everything, they were still here.

There was no recollection of anything. They didn't remember anything, neither how they got here, or how they even came to be. No memories remained at all. Staring at the sea, something rang out to them, like something long lost resided in it, like a set of forgotten memories that never quite faded, and were waiting to be recalled. They didn't even remember their name. Thoughts started to collect in their mind, like how did they get here, and why don't they remember anything, but there was no point to any of them, no answer that would come from them. They would need to settle on an adventure to answer them. Were they capable of that? They didn't even know who they were.

Motivated to answer these questions, with motivation coursing through their veins, they decided to become an adventurer, searching for their lost memories and finally answering the questions that remained. Trying to get up, a sharp pain suddenly pierced their shoulder. Checking on it, it was wounded, as through they were in a swordfight at some point. A similar one resided on their chest. Their clothes were also in rough shape, being ripped in some places, charred in others, but primarily soaked and covered in sand.

The new adventurer then carefully got up, their arm still in pain, but they likely had to get the wounds checked out, and also get something else to wear. They then slowly began their new, grand adventure, and continued through the path lead by the river. The path was fairly dark, with the tall cliffs on both sides, and the sun still not having risen enough yet to shine onto the path, which was fairly long and winding, and fairly overgrown in some areas. Some parts had cliffs on the path, likely ancient waterfalls, but it wasn't known for certain.

Continuing down the path, now no longer as dark, with the sun now higher in the sky, the flowers started to unfurl their petals for the day, and the insects started their day as well. The birds, once roosting in the trees, were slowly waking up, singing their songs once they did, causing a slow crescendo of birdsong to happen. Somewhere in the adventurers mind, a memory was recalling, of the birdsong, and the flowers, and the bees and butterflies, but there was no correlation from it, nothing that lead on from that memory. It felt more like deja vu, like they had been here before. Moving on, and coming to a collapsed stone bridge that lay in the way of the path, something lay aside the ruin, which seemed to shimmer and glitter, calling out, a similar way that the sea did as well. Coming to it, crouching down, reaching out, and grasping it, it was a fairly short sword, in no particular good condition, half of it covered with rust, the leather of the handle having worn away already, leaving the smooth wood underneath. But even so, the sword felt like it was truly powerful, being well balanced, not too heavy, but bringing weight into every swing. then you drop it and it disappears and they're like "oh where did it go" and just continue anyway.

ok, i can't be asked to write out the rest of the story right now so here's the quick version:

the adventurer encounters a slime on the bridge, gets scared and accidentally releases their elemental force (unlocks it for the player as well), and they're like "wow a sword would be useful right now" and they look into their hand and it's the sword they found again!! yay and then they defeat the slime so they're cool. they climb out of the river path with the bridge ruins and onto another path through a forest. this path clearly hasn't been walked this way in a long time, and you continue walking through it while hearing and feeling someone watching you. eventually, they jump out of the darkness and its a knight called mila (hi mila) and she interrogates you which goes kinda like this:
"Hey! Who goes there?"
"Uh, I'm just travelling through here, just trying to figure out where I am."
"Well, in case you didn't know, this area is under lock down, as instructed by the Prince. No one is to enter here. How did you get in anyway? And what's with that rusty sword? Are you causing trouble?"
you're still pretty confused so you're like looking around and hesitating and looking extremely suspicious xd also here's your dialog choices
- "Um, I don't know."
- "Take it slower, please, I was passed out on the beach 5 minutes ago"

she sighs, looking down and shaking her head.
"Whatever. I'll have to take you in for questioning anyway, since clearly you don't belong here, and it's also my job. Come with me- Oh, and give me your sword. You wouldn't want to have to explain that when you arrive at the gates. At least that way you can get it back when we release you."
"what"
"im taking you to jail because you broke the law"
"balls"

(yeah so there's just a cut to the jail now)
mila puts you in your cell and shuts the door.
"ok so you will probably be in there for a while so just stay put for now until someone comes to get you."
"how long do you think"
"uhhh between 2 days and a week"
"fuck no"
"then next time don't go into prohibited land"
"fuck you bitcj"
"that's just my job"

(editor note: this is the point in the game where you learn dungeon mechanics and you escape the jail cell get your sword back and try and escape and then after you escape there's a stealth section where you need to escape from the knights headquarters (zapierdoli mnie to potem))

now with the adventurer having escaped the knights headquarters they try and find a doctor that can help them out. they don't know their way around town, so they get someone to help them out, and they get taken to frederich, the village doctor, who looks at their wounds and is like "you know those look fine, they don't appear to have caused any major problems, ill just clean them up for you, bandage them up, and you can be on your way" and then mid cleaning mila comes back and she's like "dude what the hell whyd you leave the cell" and then you have your dialog options again:
- "i wanted to get these wounds looked at first" - mila replies "ok, well you could've said that before then.
- "i wasn't willing to be staying in that cell for that long"
<<<<<<< HEAD
- "ummm i dont know"
mila then says "also we gonna let you out 20 minutes ago but then you decide to escape and we had to spend that time searching for you instead."

the adventurer then tries to reason with mila whether getting questioned is even worth it and mila ends up being like "yeah fair point but were you doing anything bad? no? ok dont go there next time thank you" so thats done
=======

mila is like "ah, whatever. i don't care really, on second thought i should've brought you to the doctor first. you're just some random wanderer. but don't go messing around in the nightink." the adventurer has no idea what nightink is but doesn't say anything, and they go on their way.

so now you're basically back where you started
