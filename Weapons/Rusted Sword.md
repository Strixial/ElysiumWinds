A long lost sword found on your travels. A youthful aura of adventure emanates from it, despite its condition. Seems to be an old version of the [[Standard Issue Blade]].

Deals 3 - 5 regular damage, and should be obtained at around level 0. Has 1 star.

Additional notes:
- The first sword players encounter.  It's slightly hidden under a bush, so players must watch for the sparkles that come from drops.
