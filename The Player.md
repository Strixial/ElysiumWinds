The player is one of the [[The Starborn]] appointed by [[Light]] to keep tranquillity and order throughout the universe.

Scouting through the universe, like they are tasked to, they sensed an evil presence, and immediately went to investigate. To the guardian's surprise, instead of some malignant being, there was the [[Supreme Witch of the Night]]. Before they had time to call in help, as this was not going to be a one man task, the witch struck them down and the angel began the long, slow descent to the nearest world, [[Arkoi]].

The player's amulet sank to the bottom of the ocean, eventually sinking to the ruins of a long lost city, and the angel floated to a small beach on Arkoi. With the angel and the amulet separated, the angel lost their powers and memories faded away.

On Arkoi, the player is known as the Adventurer, as they're on a journey to rediscover their origins, seal the evil of the Nightink away and save Arkoi from its destruction.
