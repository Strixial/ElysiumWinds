The player is one of the [[Elysium Winds]] appointed by [[Light]] to keep tranquillity and order throughout the universe.

Scouting through the universe, like they are tasked to, they sensed an evil presence, and immediately went to investigate. To the guardian's surprise, instead of some malignant being, there was the [[Supreme Witch of the Night]]. Before they had time to call in help, as this was not going to be a one man task, the witch struck them down and the angel began the long, slow descent to the nearest world, [[Arkoi]].

The weapon sank to the bottom of the ocean, and the angel floated to a small beach on Arkoi. With the angel and the weapon separated, the angel lost their powers and memories faded away.
