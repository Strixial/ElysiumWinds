Elemental resonance is how effectively a person can manipulate an element. For example, a fire-resonating person will be more adept at controlling fire then air.

The adventurer's resonance depends on what elements are nearby or available to them. It changes depending on the environment and situation, and if they have a resonator equipped, they will use that element specifically.
