The sole ruler and creator of [[The Universe]].

Light was once one of the members of the 9 of All, but once Time offered their place of the throne, everything turned to chaos and the 9 of All dispelled.

Seeking to avoid the war in the Aetherspace, they found an empty universe for them to reside in, and started creating their perfect universe, one without war and conflict, and filled with beauty and peace.

To keep it safe from any gods looking to destroy their universe, the [[Elysium Winds]] were born to keep the tranquility of the universe, a small army with only one goal in mind: to keep the universe safe and bring peace to all worlds they might visit.

After this, it's said that Light now eternally rests on their own world in the center of the universe, made of all that is good. Those who are good in life go to rest with them as well, once their time comes.
