Combat in Elysium Winds is designed to be easy to learn but hard to master. It also should be kept fun and intuitive, however for veterans of the game more play styles can be introduced for them to keep the gameplay fresh, by adding combo hits, weapon combinations, interaction between many different [[weapons]], and so on.
