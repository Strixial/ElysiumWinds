Combat in Elysium Winds is designed to be easy to learn but hard to master. It also should be kept fun and intuitive, however for veterans of the game more play styles can be introduced for them to keep the gameplay fresh, by adding combo hits, weapon combinations, interaction between many different [[weapons]], and so on.

The combat moves in Elysium Winds are:
- Primary Attack - A simple attack using your weapon of choice, with a sword, you swing it, with a bow, you fire an arrow.
- Secondary Attack - A heavy attack that does lots of damage. Has a while to cool down and uses [[stamina]].
- Block - If you have a shield or sword equipped, blocking allows you to cancel damage and knockback. This does cause damage to what you're blocking with though.
- Parry - Blocking when you're about to be hit causes a parry - which can reflect projectiles, certain spells and other swords.
- Dive charge - while gliding, doing a secondary attack will make you charge instantly downwards to make a large AOE attack that causes huge amounts of damage (proportional to the time you spent falling).
- Spellcasting - Using spells in battle to deal damage. See [[spells]].
