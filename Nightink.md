A spread of evil and corruption throughout the universe, lead by the [[Supreme Witch of the Night]]. It absorbs [[Elemental Trace]], therefore casting any spells that require it (which is the vast majority of them) to be very weak or simply fail.

The primary driving force behind the nightink's spread is unknown.

The nightink's name comes from how areas most infected by it grow an inky ooze from all living surfaces (trees, grass, and other plants), that is described to be "as dark as the night".
