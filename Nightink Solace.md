Nightink Solaces are buildings of the Nightink where certain important figures that manage it (as it's not all chaos, there has to be some management over it) reside or work in.

These usually are built by the nightink, but sometimes existing buildings can be taken over and merely converted if the resident chooses to.

The largest and most important solace on Arkoi is the Cathedral of Death, where [[Kham]] lives.
