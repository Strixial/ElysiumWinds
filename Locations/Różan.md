## Overview
---
The capital city of [[Nochflori]], known for it's beautiful roses, rumors of vampiric royalty, and for having a very wealthy population of traders and business owners.

At the centre of the city, standing high enough that it can even be seen from outside the city walls, is [[Cherna Castle]], home to said vampiric royalty.

It is the second city that the adventurer discovers, in the hopes of discovering more about Arkoi and also to enroll within the [[Royal Society of Explorers]].

## History

Rozan *(can't be asked to spell it anymore)* is a very old city, built shortly after the collapse of the [[Khamuta Imperium]] following the [[30 Year Bloodshed]] and founded by the [[Krewni]] family. The name of the city comes from the rose flowers that would grow in the area, and which also were cultivated in the city to sell, as these flowers were of exceptional quality. 

At one point, a debate about whether the roses should remain in the city sparked and caused chaos within several important families that were close to the Krewni. After many duels, some being fatal, and an assassination attempt, the Krewni put an end to the debate by saying that the roses were to stay in the city, as long as the Krewni remain on the throne. The original bloodline that once founded the city still reigns, even though at one point they were all almost lost.

Some say that the reason that the roses bloom so much and so deeply red as they do in Rozan is because of how much blood is spilt in the city.
