An ancient library, part of the Kleks Academia. It is open to the general public, unlike the Academia. Many students from the academy go here, as well as other scholars from around the world.

It's home to the largest collection of literature on Arkoi and is where most nations opt to preserve their own vital documents that the general public may need, such as cencuses.
