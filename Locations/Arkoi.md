Arkoi is the third planet from it's star and one of the few astronomical objects in the universe that can support life. Arkoi's surface is mostly covered by water, with 78% of the surface being covered by water, and the remaining 22% being land.

On average, Arkoi maintains a temperature of about 18Â° Celcius, with an atmospheric pressure of about 98.342 kPa (at sea level), and a surface gravity of 16 m/s^2. Despite the strong gravitational pull, life on the planet seems to live with it just fine.

Most of the land on Arkoi is separated into two large continental landmasses, with smaller islands that can be found elsewhere. Arkoi is fairly humid and covered by vegetation, however some areas near the equator are extremely hot, driving away water from that area to form large deserts.
