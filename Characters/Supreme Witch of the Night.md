Kham Tavish DeTrauss is the regional leader of where Arkoi is in the cosmos and also the Supreme Witch of the Night, in charge of conjuring more nightink from elemental trace.

Her character is a bit strange, where most witches are seen to be calculated and cunning, she is a bit of an airhead and can sometimes seem to lack intelligence, despite her being one of the greatest minds of the universe.

She lives on Arkoi in the Cathedral of Death because "it's the biggest and coolest cathedral she has ever seen".

It's said she is like this because she spends almost all of her brain power on coming up with ways to spread the nightink, leaving not much for actual thought.
