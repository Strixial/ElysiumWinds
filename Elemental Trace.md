Elemental trace is a [[#^ed9f04|pseudo-substance]] which is able to be manipulated into many different forms.

Its primary use case on [[Arkoi]] is for magic spells that are used by its residents.

However, due to the [[nightink]] present, it gets absorbed into it and thus is not very usable. Only until the nightink gets eradicated, will it be usable as it once was.

### Composition

^ed9f04

Elemental trace is not necessarily a form of matter, but more like energy pooled into a matter like being, with it sharing some characteristics of matter, but ultimately it is not matter.

Used in a multitude of ways, due to its extremely malleable form, it's primary use is as a fuel for spellcasting, but some machines take it as fuel as well.

Extraction of elemental trace can vary from the deposit of the trace. Usually it is present in the atmosphere in a gas-like form, in which it has the highest energy and most value, but liquid and solid forms also exist, usually underground in deposits or lakes. Solid elemental trace can be melted down into it's liquid form, where it has more use, but it cannot evaporate into a gas, without extreme temperatures.

Elemental trace as a gas has been attempted to have been captured before, as it is the most pure and useful form of it, but most attempts have been either small scale or unsuccessful, due to the fact that it can react with it's container and escape through it by metamorphosis into a different energy form. For example, keeping it in a steel container will cause it to metamorphosize into electrical energy and escape through ground. Liquid elemental trace does not have this issue, and so is widely and easily contained.
