Elemental trace is a [[#^ed9f04|pseudo-substance]] which is able to be manipulated into many different forms.

Its primary use case on [[Arkoi]] is for magic spells that are used by its residents.

However, due to the [[nightink]] present, it gets absorbed into it and thus is not very usable. Only until the nightink gets eradicated, will it be usable as it once was.

### Composition

^ed9f04

Elemental trace is not necessarily a form of matter, but more like energy pooled into a matter like being, with it sharing some characteristics of matter, but ultimately it is not matter.
