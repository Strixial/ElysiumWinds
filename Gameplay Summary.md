In terms of the gameplay, it follows a fairly simple loop when condensed down to it's very core elements:

* Explore the world
* Fight enemies
* Get rewards
* Upgrade gear

In the first step, exploring the world, players have to go out and search for a new location that is relevant to what they're looking to do. This could be a quest, getting a certain item needed to level up some gear, or simply looking to find a friend.

Then, fighting enemies, which is fairly self-explanatory. To reach their goal, they will encounter enemies along the way, so they have to fight them. Details of fighting are in the [[Combat]] page.

Afterwards, getting rewards, which is also self-explanatory. After having reached their goal, they get their reward, which could be rewards from the quest, getting that certain item to level up their gear, or having found their friend at last.

Finally, upgrading gear. With the new treasure the player now has, the player upgrades the gear they have so that they can get better at fighting enemies.

There can be more steps in between in order to add more to do, like a puzzle, random events, "trial modes" where a player obtains an item as a trial (which can help boost engagement as players know what to look forward to), mini bosses, the list goes on.

Also, players can take a break from the core loop and do other activities in game, like fishing, collecting research on flora and fauna, and fighting other players in arenas.
